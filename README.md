# File uploading on Amazon S3 Bucket using Spring Boot with Cloud. #

As you may notice almost each application, mobile or web, gives users an ability to upload their images, photos, avatars etc. So you, as a developer, should choose the best way how to save and where to store these files.

There are different approaches for storing files:
    * directly on the server where an application is deployed
    * in the database as a binary file
    * using some cloud storages
